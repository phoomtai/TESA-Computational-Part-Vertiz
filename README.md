## Overview of Top Gun Rally

Top Gun Rally is an annual competition organized by the Thai Embedded Systems Association (TESA). The competition is similar to a hackathon, with teams of five students competing against each other. The competition is divided into three main parts:

- Hardware (AIoT Development)
- Server
- Data Analysis (Hydrological Modeling)

Each team is assigned to a different part of the competition. During the morning, each team member attends a workshop on their assigned part. In the afternoon, each team works on a project related to their assigned part.
